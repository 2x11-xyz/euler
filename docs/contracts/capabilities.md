# Capability Contract

Capabilities govern tools, extensions, and child agents.

Child agents may only receive capabilities that are a subset of the parent
session's capabilities. In v0, agent capability attenuation uses exact set
semantics over the flat `Capability` strings below. Equality is allowed.
Path-aware, host-aware, provider-aware, model-aware, and secret-name-aware
narrowing are deferred until capabilities gain structured scope fields.

There are no trusted bypass flags for normal workflows. If a first-party extension cannot do its job without a bypass, the capability model is wrong.

## Trust Model Honesty

Native Rust extensions run in-process. They are trusted, audited code: the
capability model constrains what the *host APIs* will do for them and records
every decision in provenance, but it is not a sandbox — in-process native code
that ignores the host APIs is limited only by the operating system. What
capabilities buy for native extensions is least-privilege discipline, a
reviewable declared-authority surface, and an audit trail; containment of
actually-untrusted code requires the out-of-process transport (roadmap) with
OS-level isolation. Do not describe native extension capabilities as a
security boundary against malicious extensions.

## V0 Capability Scopes

Minimum v0 scopes:

- `fs-read`
- `fs-write`
- `provenance-read`
- `diagnostics-read`
- `artifact-write`
- `agent-record`
- `context-slot`
- `shell-exec`
- `network`
- `config-write`
- `secret-resolve`

## Approval Modes

A capability decision is one of:

- `ask` — prompt the user at use time.
- `session-allow` — allow for the current session/scope.
- `always-deny` — deny without prompting.

Permission prompts and decisions are session events and are recorded in provenance. Privileged secret/config edits always require explicit approval even if broader write access was granted.

`provenance-read` gates host-mediated bounded provenance queries. It is not
raw filesystem read access. The v0 pull-based event feed uses this same
capability because it reads the accepted durable provenance prefix through the
same bounded host API. The current process-local wake primitive is not exposed
to extension or child-agent code and therefore adds no new capability. Future
live push/background subscription may require a separate capability if it
exposes materially different privilege or timing semantics.

`diagnostics-read` gates host-mediated bounded reads of the current session's
diagnostics log lines. It is not raw filesystem read access.

`artifact-write` gates host-mediated extension artifact writes. It is not raw
filesystem write access and does not permit arbitrary extension state writes.
Extension private state directory access remains `fs-write`-gated.

`agent-record` gates host-mediated immediate child-agent completion records.
It lets an extension command ask the host to append one validated `agent.spawn`
event followed by one terminal `agent.result` event through the owning session
writer. It is not live model invocation, a scheduler, a durable background
worker, an observer daemon, or an arbitrary child-process launcher. Child
capabilities use the same exact flat subset semantics as core child agents:
the child set may be empty or equal to the command grant, duplicates are
normalized, and escalation fails before the host appends any agent events.

Extension event-feed checkpoints are private extension state:

- `HostApi::load_event_feed_checkpoint` requires `fs-read`.
- `HostApi::store_event_feed_checkpoint` requires `fs-write`.
- `fs-write` permits the host to perform internal directory reads needed for
  safe checkpoint replacement, quota checks, and file-type validation, but it
  does not grant the extension read access to existing checkpoint contents.
- Bundled extensions that use durable cursors, such as `causal-dag.update`,
  must declare these capabilities even when they access checkpoints only
  through host APIs. The authority remains session-private checkpoint state, not
  arbitrary path access.

- Native extension manifests declare the maximum capability envelope for the
  extension. Each command declares its own required-capability set on its
  `CommandDescriptor`; that is the sole source of command capabilities. An
  empty set means no capabilities — there is no inheritance from the manifest
  envelope. A command's set must be a subset of the manifest envelope,
  enforced at registration.

`context-slot` gates host-mediated extension context slot updates. It permits an
extension command to append bounded `context.slot.updated` events for slots
namespaced to that extension id. It does not grant raw provenance reads,
arbitrary canvas control, or cross-extension slot writes.

`fs-read` defaults to `session-allow`: read tools execute without prompting, but every execution records a permission decision event. `fs-write` and `shell-exec` default to `ask`.
