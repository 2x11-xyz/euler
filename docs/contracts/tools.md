# Tool Contract

Core tools are the minimal coding substrate.

Tool calls must be permission checked, provenance logged, and represented cleanly in the active canvas.

Extension tools use the same contract as core tools. There should not be a second-class tool path.

## Tool Ergonomics

Tools define the agent's information contract. A core tool must support
token-efficient, targeted retrieval: when output can exceed reasonable
context cost, the tool must offer a narrower handle (line range, filter,
query, or pagination) alongside truncation, and its truncation marker must
say how to get the rest. Truncation without a handle is a defect.

Evidence: an early dogfood projection-task failure,
where an agent exhausted its tool budget re-reading a 523-line file that
`read_file` would only return truncated. Rationale and sources:
the context-engineering principle above.
